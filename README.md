# Simple React Redux Boilerplate

I created this repo for the purposes of following along with Dan Abromov's egghead tutorials seen here:

[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
[Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)

If you follow along with these courses you may need to install aditional dependencies:

```
npm install --save expect
npm install --save deep-freeze
npm install --save react-router
```

And import as needed:

```javascript
import expect from 'expect';
import deepFreeze from 'deep-freeze';
import { Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router'
```

Really, feel free to use this repo for what you want!
